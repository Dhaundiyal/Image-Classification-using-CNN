# Image-Classification-using-CNN
This repository contains code for building and training an image classifier using TensorFlow. The classifier is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and trained on a dataset of images.

## Project Description
This project aims to build a robust image classifier using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. The classifier is designed to accurately classify images into predefined categories or classes. Leveraging convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, the model learns intricate patterns and features from the input images, allowing it to make accurate predictions even on unseen data.

### Key Features:
Dataset Preprocessing: The project includes scripts for preprocessing the dataset, ensuring data cleanliness and readiness for training.
Model Training: The classifier is trained using a comprehensive dataset, enabling it to learn intricate patterns and features necessary for accurate classification.
Evaluation and Testing: The trained model is evaluated and tested on separate datasets to assess its performance and generalization capabilities.
User-Friendly Interface: The project provides a simple interface for users to interact with the trained model, allowing them to test its predictions on their own images.

## Use Cases
Image Classification: The image classifier can be used in various applications such as object recognition, image tagging, content filtering, and more.
Research and Development: Researchers and developers can leverage the project as a baseline for developing more advanced image classification models or exploring novel techniques in deep learning.

## Why Tensorflow
TensorFlow is chosen as the primary framework due to its versatility, scalability, and extensive community support. It provides a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries for building and deploying machine learning models, making it an ideal choice for this image classification project.
